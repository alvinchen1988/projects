				<h1>Technology</h1>
				<h2>The B.A.T of Internet in China</h2>
				<p>Some two decades ago, China was introduced to something very novel. It’s called the Internet. It’s now become an indispensable part of the nation's economy and an intregral part of many Chinese people's daily life. Nowadays just about everything can be done online: shop for clothes, food, or an apartment.</p>
				<p>BAT or B-A-T is short for the names of the three giants of China's internet. There's Baidu, the dominant search engine; Alibaba, which controls 80 per cent of China's e-commerce, and Tencent, the gaming and social media juggernaut. It used to be that each of these companies had a distinct sphere of operation, but now as can you see from this tangled web here, they are snapping up stakes in smaller firms, expanding far beyond their core areas of search, e-commerce, gaming and messaging to compete on each other’s turf and in fast-developing areas such as maps, video and travel. The competition we're seeing in China’s internet industry today, is something we've never before seen in the country.</p>
